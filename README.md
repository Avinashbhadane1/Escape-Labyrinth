this is the game i created using unity. its 3d. the assets that i have used are from blink, mutant monster and decreipt dungeon from unity asset store. the main reason for such was the animation and characters
along with basic game design. i have used character controller of iHeartGameDev which is just the basic implementation of unity character controller. the enemy follows you which is made with the help of navMesh and ai configurations in unity.
i learned through it the basics of navmesh, agents , surface and baking tools as well. the camera movement i have used is cinemachine camera which provides a lot of options and utility. the basic game is to find three keys and escape the labyrinth 
while being chased by a mutant monster(powered by ai tools in unity engine). the charcater abilities includes creation of body double which effectively provides that it wont die if both of them dont die also the skill duration is onyl 30 sec wherin the 
monster will chase he other entity. a minimap is used which helps for navigation.
